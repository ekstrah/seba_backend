# Project Overview

This appears to be a Node.js backend project with a well-organized structure. Let me break down the key components:

---

## 1. **Core Application Files**
- `server.js`: The main entry point of the application
- `package.json` & `package-lock.json`: Node.js dependency management
- `.env` related files: Environment configuration (with `example.env` as a template)

---

## 2. **Main Application Directories**
- `controllers/`: Contains the business logic handlers
- `models/`: Database models/schemas
- `routes/`: API route definitions
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `db/`: Database related files and configurations

---

## 3. **Testing and Development**
- `tests/`: Test files
- `test-integration.sh`: Integration testing script
- `.babelrc`: Babel configuration for modern JavaScript
- `eslint.config.js`: ESLint configuration for code quality

---

## 4. **DevOps and Deployment**
- `docker/`: Docker configuration files
- `.dockerignore`: Docker build exclusions
- `Jenkinsfile`: CI/CD pipeline configuration
- `CHANGELOG`: Version history and changes

---

## 5. **Additional Features**
- `mailtrap/`: Email testing/sending functionality

---

## Technology Stack

Based on the `package.json` and `server.js`, the project uses:

- Node.js with Express.js as the web framework
- MongoDB (using Mongoose) as the database
- JWT (`jsonwebtoken`) for authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Mailtrap for email functionality
- Docker for containerization
- Jenkins for CI/CD

---

## Main Features

### 1. **Authentication System** (`/api/auth`)
- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Cookie-based session management

### 2. **Product Management** (`/api/product`)
- Product CRUD operations
- Product categorization

### 3. **Category Management** (`/api/category`)
- Category CRUD operations

### 4. **Shopping Cart** (`/api/cart`)
- Cart management functionality

### 5. **Order Management** (`/api/order-item`)
- Order processing and management

## Development Setup

- Development server with hot-reload (`npm run dev`)
- Linting with ESLint (`npm run lint`)
- Integration testing with Newman/Postman
- Environment configuration via `.env` files
- Docker support for containerization

## Project Structure Summary

The project is structured with clear separation of concerns:
- Controllers for business logic
- Models for database schemas
- Routes for defining endpoints
- Middleware for processing requests
- Utils for shared helpers
- Tests for verifying functionality

Also includes:
- Docker files for containerization
- Jenkinsfile for CI/CD automation
- Mailtrap integration for email handling
